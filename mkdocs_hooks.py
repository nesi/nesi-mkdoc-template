mkdocs_hooks allows injection of variables into templating stage of rendering.
This allows for arbitrary use of variables in TEMPLATE FILES, (e.g. `overrides/*.html`).
As opposed to `macro_hooks.py` which injects variables into macro rendering (e.g. `docs/*.md`).
If this is confusing, ask Cal to explain.
